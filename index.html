    <h2>Technical Recruiter:</h2>

    The technical recruiter need not only to have the ability to realistically source, screen, and present qualified candidates, but the confidence to communicate unrealistic technical requirements goals to hiring managers. This is the technical recruiter’s profile description.

The areas of responsibilities/skills for the Technical Recruiter include:

Review. Successfully review job descriptions in to understand the needs of the hiring manager as well to ask questions that’ll help you identify the right candidate(s). This is by far the most important skill a technical recruiter needs.
Understand technology, technical roles and technical skills. Learn and evaluate your technical skills
Identify. Sourcing and uncovering candidates
Screen. Ascertaining the competence of candidates against a technical job description
Interview. Meeting candidates in person, telephone, or video conference etc to assess their qualifications
Following up. Keep your candidates in the loop. This goes a long way to build your credibility and  keep your candidates either coming back to you or sending referrals to you. Read my article on following up with candidates and also why candidates are rude to their recruiters
Present. Showing or offering candidate resume to hiring managers to scrutinize or consider
The end result needs to be the presentation of employ-able and qualified candidates for technical positions in various industries and for job roles such as in software development, systems administration, database, architecture, business processes etc.
